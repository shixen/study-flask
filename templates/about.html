    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
    came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
    decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf
    also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The
    superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other
    business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

        <h3>Thorin okenshield</h3>
        <p>
            Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his
            youth, Thorin and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug, in TA
            2770. While in exile, he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was demonstrated at the Battle of
            Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's East-gate, and
            at some point in the battle, his shield broke, and, using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a
            shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which remained with him even in death.[2]

        <h3>Fili and kili</h3>
        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were Dwarvern brothers and were also the youngest of the thirteen Dwarves who set out with
            Thorin Oakenshield's company, along with Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins, to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the
            dragon Smaug.

            Fíli and Kíli were the two most active Dwarves of Thorin's company, and, apart from Balin and possibly
            Bombur, they appear more frequently as "individual" characters in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit than the rest
            of Thorin's companions, who are most often named only in group-reference.

    <h3>Glóin</h3>
    <p>
        Glóin, son of Gróin was one of the Dwarves of Thorin II Oakenshield's company who set out to reclaim the Lonely
        Mountain in the Quest of Erebor. He was also the father of Gimli, who became a member of the Fellowship of the
        Ring.

        Glóin chiefly appears in The Hobbit as a supporting character. Glóin also appears in The Fellowship of the Ring
        during the Council of Elrond.

    <h3>Balin</h3>
    <p>
        Balin was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of Dwalin. He was one of the thirteen Dwarves who
        accompanied Thorin II Oakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain.
        A Dwarf Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Thorin's closest friends and
        advisers. Balin was distantly related to him, and a descendant of the noble House of Durin.

        He later went to re-establish the Dwarf presence in Moria, but within five years it was overcome once more by
        Orcs, and he was killed there along with the rest of his companions.
